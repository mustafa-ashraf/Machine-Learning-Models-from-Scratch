## Introduction

Machine learning is a field that relies on mathematical principles to build predictive models from data. This repository aims to provide a deeper understanding of three widely used machine learning algorithms: KNN, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression. By implementing these models from scratch, we can gain insights into the underlying mathematics and concepts.

## Project Overview

Machine learning models have become integral in various domains, from recommendation systems to medical diagnosis. Understanding how these models function at their core is essential for building expertise in the field. In this project, we focus on the following objectives:

- Implement KNN, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression from scratch.
- Provide detailed explanations of the mathematics and principles behind these algorithms.
- Offer code examples, visualizations, and usage guidelines to help users grasp the concepts.

## Implemented Models

### k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It relies on the principle of similarity among data points to make predictions. Our KNN implementation covers:

- Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance)
- Choosing the right value for 'k'
- Classification and regression examples

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm for predicting numerical values based on input features. We delve into the following aspects:

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method
- Feature scaling
- Gradient Descent for optimization
- Visualization of regression lines

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used for binary classification tasks. This section covers:

- Sigmoid function
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Regularization (e.g., L1 and L2)
